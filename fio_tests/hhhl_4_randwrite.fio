# runtime is how long the test will run in seconds.

# filesize sets the size of the test file plot.

# cpus_allowed_policy changes how the threads are locked. This can be changed to shared or split. Split dedicates one thread to one job
# shared will allow more than one job to run a thread. Tweak for performance.
cpus_allowed_policy=shared

# numjobs sets the amount of threads to run per job. ie. if numbjobs=2 than each job will run two tests on the m.2. Change value to see where performance is the best. 
numjobs=2

# do not change invalidate. If set to 0 your test will not be valid.
invalidate=1

# ramp_time sets the amount of time to warm up the drives. Longer ramp times will fill the write buffer so you are able to log data for sustained writes only.

# How to use this job file:
# Job structure is broken down into four values, job number defined as [job$], job type as defined by rw=$$, 
# target for test is defined by filename=/dev/nvme$n$ and the name of the test as defined by name=$$=$$$.



# Remove comment to switch test mode.
# write = seq write
# read = seq read
# rw = seq read and write
# randread random reads
# randwrite = random writes
# randrw = random reads and writes
# trimwrite = before writing the block will be trimmed and then written. Probably won't ever be used.
