# How to use this job file:
# Job structure is broken down into four values, job number defined as [job$], job type as defined by rw=$$, 
# target for test is defined by filename=/dev/nvme$n$ and the name of the test as defined by name=$$=$$$.



# Remove comment to switch test mode.
# write = seq write
# read = seq read
# rw = seq read and write
# randread random reads
# randwrite = random writes
# randrw = random reads and writes
# trimwrite = before writing the block will be trimmed and then written. Probably won't ever be used.
